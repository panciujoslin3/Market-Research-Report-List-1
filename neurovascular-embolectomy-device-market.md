<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurovascular Embolectomy Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aspiration Systems</li><li>Stent Retreival Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neurovascular embolectomy device market includes two primary types: aspiration systems and stent retrieval systems. Aspiration systems utilize suction to remove blood clots from cerebral arteries, effectively restoring blood flow. In contrast, stent retrieval systems deploy a stent-like device to capture and extract clots mechanically. Both technologies aim to treat conditions like ischemic stroke, enhancing patient outcomes by minimizing brain damage and promoting rapid recovery. The choice between systems often depends on the specific clinical scenario and the size of the clot.</p></p>
