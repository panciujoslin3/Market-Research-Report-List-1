<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foley Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Catheters</li><li>Uncoated Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Foley catheters market is divided into two primary types: coated and uncoated catheters. Coated catheters are designed with a specialized surface treatment, often incorporating materials like hydrophilic coatings to enhance comfort, reduce friction, and minimize the risk of infection. Uncoated catheters, on the other hand, lack these specialized surfaces and are typically simpler in design, making them more cost-effective but potentially less comfortable for long-term use. Both types serve essential functions in urinary management and healthcare settings.</p></p>
