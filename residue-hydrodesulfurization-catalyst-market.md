<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residue Hydrodesulfurization Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Supported Catalyst</li><li>Dispersible Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Residue Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalyst market is primarily divided into two types: supported catalysts and dispersible catalysts. Supported catalysts are typically fixed on a substrate, enhancing their stability and efficiency in removing sulfur from petroleum residues. In contrast, dispersible catalysts are more flexible, allowing for easier mixing and application in various processes. Both types play crucial roles in meeting stringent environmental regulations by effectively reducing sulfur content in fuels, contributing to cleaner combustion and lower emissions in the energy sector.</p></p>
