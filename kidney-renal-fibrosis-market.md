<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kidney (Renal) Fibrosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angiotensin Converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors</li><li>Pirfenidone</li><li>Renin Inhibitors</li><li>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)</li><li>Vasopeptidase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Kidney (Renal) Fibrosis market encompasses various treatment options aimed at managing or reversing fibrosis in renal tissues. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors help lower blood pressure and reduce kidney strain. Pirfenidone, known for its anti-fibrotic properties, targets fibrosis directly. Renin Inhibitors block renin, reducing hypertension-related damage. Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) prevent the effects of angiotensin II, mitigating renal stress. Vasopeptidase Inhibitors combine ACE inhibition and neutral endopeptidase inhibition, offering a dual approach to combat kidney fibrosis.</p></p>
